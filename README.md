# Project Kickstart Script using Aider

## Description

This repository contains a Bash script, `kickstart.sh`, designed to automate the initial setup of standard project documentation for new software projects. It leverages `aider`, an AI pair programming tool, to generate content for these documents and uses Git for version control.

The script aims to quickly establish a baseline set of project files, allowing development teams to focus on building features rather than boilerplate documentation.

## Features

- Creates a `docs/` directory if it doesn't exist.
- Generates the following project documents with placeholder content:
    - `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`: Outlines design requirements.
    - `docs/DESIGN.md`: Reflects the current project design.
    - `docs/LIBRARIES.md`: Lists considered and chosen libraries.
    - `docs/TESTING.md`: Describes testing strategy and methodology.
    - `README.md`: Provides a template for the new project's README.
    - `TODO.md`: Sets up a basic Kanban-style task tracker.
- Ensures each generated file is created if it doesn't exist.
- Uses `aider` non-interactively to populate the files based on predefined prompts.
- Automatically adds and commits each generated document to the Git repository with a descriptive commit message (e.g., "AI: Create docs/REQUIREMENTS.md").

## Prerequisites

Before running the `kickstart.sh` script, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1.  **Bash:** The script is written for Bash.
2.  **Git:** The script must be run from the root of a Git repository. Initialize a new Git repository (`git init`) if one doesn't exist for your new project.
3.  **Aider:** `aider` must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
    -   Ensure `aider` is configured with the necessary API keys (e.g., OpenAI API key) for it to function. Refer to the [aider documentation](https://aider.chat/docs/install.html) for installation and configuration instructions.

## Usage

1.  **Clone this repository (or copy `kickstart.sh`):**
    If you've cloned this repository, you can navigate into it. Otherwise, ensure `kickstart.sh` is in the root directory of the new project you want to kickstart.

2.  **Navigate to your new project's root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/new-project
    ```

3.  **Initialize a Git repository (if not already done):**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

4.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x kickstart.sh
    ```

5.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./kickstart.sh
    ```

The script will then proceed to create the `docs/` directory and generate each document, committing them one by one.

## How It Works

The `kickstart.sh` script performs the following steps:

1.  **Initialization:**
    -   Sets shell options for robust error handling (`set -euo pipefail`).
    -   Checks if it's being run from within a Git repository.
    -   Creates the `docs/` directory.
2.  **Document Generation:**
    -   For each predefined document:
        -   Ensures the target file exists (using `touch`).
        -   Invokes `aider` with a specific prompt for that document, the target filename, and flags (`--message`, `--yes-always`, `--no-auto-commits`) for non-interactive operation.
        -   Adds the generated/modified file to Git staging (`git add`).
        -   Commits the file with a standardized message (`git commit -m "AI: Create <filename>"`).
3.  **Completion:**
    -   Outputs a message indicating the process is complete.

The prompts used for `aider` are embedded within the `kickstart.sh` script and are designed to generate useful template structures for each document.

## Generated Documents by `kickstart.sh`

The script will create and populate the following files within the target project:

-   `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`
-   `docs/DESIGN.md`
-   `docs/LIBRARIES.md`
-   `docs/TESTING.md`
-   `README.md` (for the target project)
-   `TODO.md`
